This repo uses the xively channel visualization code in order to display the temperature in my office at UCLA. I set it up when there was a power outtage on the HVAC in 2015 during a heat wave. It would publish the temperature online so I could check in from home to see if it was too hot to come into the office. If it is no longer 2015, I have no idea what the repo is being used for. Maybe the same thing.
